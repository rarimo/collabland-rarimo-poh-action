This repo implements an [Collab.Land] action to add `/verify` command to your Discord server and
allow members to
verify their humanity using the [Rarimo Proof of Humanity] case.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

#### Environment:

- Node.JS 18.14.0 [**[Download Here]**]

#### Tunnel Forwarding:

- ngrok [**[Installation Instructions]**]

#### Switching on signature verification:

- In order to verify the webhook requests coming from the Collab.Land bot, please delete
  the `SKIP_VERIFICATION` variable in your `.env` file and restart the server.
- Please fetch the public key from the [**[Collab.Land Config]**], and replace
  your `COLLABLAND_ACTION_PUBLIC_KEY` variable in the `.env` file.

## Setup

### Starting the server:

- Clone the repository to your machine
- Open the folder in a code editor of your choice
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  yarn install
  ```
- Build the project:
  ```bash
  yarn run build
  ```
- Start the server (The server starts in port `3000` by default):
  ```bash
  yarn start
  ```
- If the server fails due to the port being occupied, start the server in a different port:
  ```bash
  PORT=5000 yarn start
  ```
- To expose your localhost API to public domain, open a new terminal and start NGROK:
  ```bash
  ngrok http <PORT>
  ```
- Copy the `.ngrok.io` link shown in your terminal

## Installing the Collab.Land actions:

- The API exposes such types of Collab.Land actions:
  - `<NGROK URL>/verify` : Verify Discord server members via [Rarimo Proof of Humanity] use case.
- Use the `/test-flight install action-url: <Your action URL>` command in the Collab.Land Bot to
  install the Rarimo Proof of Humanity verification Collab.Land action.

## API Specifications

- The API exposes two routes per slash command:
  - GET `/verify/metadata` : To provide the metadata for the `/verify` command
  - POST `/verify/interactions` : To handle the Discord interactions corresponding to the `/verify`
    command
- The slash commands provide example codes for the following Discord interactions:
  - `/verify` : It shows how to interact with a basic slash command Discord interaction, and then
    reply to that interaction.
