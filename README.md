<div align="center"><h1><b>Rarimo Proof of Humanity Collab.Land Action</b></h1></div>

This repo implements an [Collab.Land] action to add `/verify` command to your Discord server and
allow members to verify their humanity using the [Rarimo Proof of Humanity] case.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

#### Environment:

- **[Node.JS >= version 18]**
- **[Docker]**

#### Tunnel Forwarding:

- **[ngrok]**

## Configuration

- In order to verify the webhook requests coming from the Collab.Land bot, please set
  the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SKIP_VERIFICATION` variable in your `.env` file to `false`.
- Please, fetch the public key from the [**[Collab.Land Config]**], and replace
  your `NEXT_PUBLIC_COLLABLAND_PUBLIC_KEY` variable in the `.env` file.

Check the `.env` file [example config file] for more details.

### Slash command names

Slash command names could be changed in `.env` file, if needed, by the default, they are `setup` and
`verify` accordingly:

```bash
# file .env

NEXT_PUBLIC_SETUP_COMMAND_NAME="my-setup-command"
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERIFY_COMMAND_NAME="my-verify-command
```

## Setup

### Starting the server:

- Clone the repository to your machine
- Open the folder in a code editor of your choice
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  yarn install
  ```
- Run Postgres in Docker:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```
- Start the server (The server starts in port `8000` by default):
  ```bash
  yarn dev
  ```
- If the server fails due to the port being occupied, change the server port in the [package.json]
  file and in the `.env` file accordingly:
  ```json
  // file: package.json

  {
    "scripts": {
      "dev-server": "next dev -p <PORT>"
    }
  }
  ```
  ```bash
  # file: .env

  NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:<PORT>"
  ```
- To expose your localhost API to public domain, open a new terminal and start NGROK:
  ```bash
  ngrok http <PORT>
  ```
- Copy the `.ngrok.io` link shown in your terminal:
  ```bash
  # Example:

  https://0c49-2601-646-9e00-80-3964-47d-7146-ff13.ngrok.io/
  ```

## Run with Docker

### Build

Before the build replace database url in the `.env` file with the following:

```bash
# file: .env

NEXT_PUBLIC_DB_URL="postgresql://rarimo-poh:rarimo-poh@rarimo-poh-db:5432/rarimo-poh-db?sslmode=disable"
```

To build the Docker image, run the following command:

```bash
docker build . -t rarimo-poh:latest
```

### Run

1. Uncomment following lines in the [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file:
    ```yaml
    # file: docker-compose.yml

    # uncomment to test local build
    #
    #  rarimo-poh:
    #    image: rarimo-poh:latest
    #    restart: unless-stopped
    #    entrypoint: sh -c "node_modules/.bin/knex migrate:up && node_modules/.bin/next start"
    #    ports:
    #      - "8000:8000"
    ```

2. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    Application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`, if you didn't change the port in the
    [package.json] file and in the `.env` file, otherwise, you have to change the port accordingly in
    the `docker-compose.yml` file in the `ports` section:

    ```yaml
    # file: docker-compose.yml

    services:
      rarimo-poh:
        image: rarimo-poh:latest
        restart: unless-stopped
        entrypoint: sh -c "node_modules/.bin/knex migrate:up && node_modules/.bin/next start"
        ports:
          - "<PORT>:8000"
    ```
