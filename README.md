## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

#### Environment

- **[Node.JS >= version 18]**
- **[Docker]**

#### Tunnel Forwarding

- **[ngrok]**

## Configuration

- Set `APP_URL` to the URL of your application in the `.env` file. This URL will be used
  to redirect users after they verify their humanity. By default, it should be `http://localhost:8000`
  if you didn't change the port (check [Starting the server](#starting-the-server))
- Set `POH_APP_URL` to the according url of the Rarimo Proof of Humanity application in
  the `.env` file. By default, it should be `https://robotornot.mainnet-beta.rarimo.com` for the
  `devnet` and `https://robotornot.rarimo.com` for the `mainnet`.
- (Optional) In order to verify the webhook requests coming from the Collab.Land bot, please set
  the `SKIP_VERIFICATION` variable in your `.env` file to `false`.
- Please, fetch the public key from the [**[Collab.Land Config]**], and replace
  your `COLLABLAND_ECDSA_PUBLIC_KEY`, `COLLABLAND_ED25519_PUBLIC_KEY_HEX`
  variables in the `.env` file.
- (Optional) Set `LOG_LEVEL` to `debug` or `info` in the `.env` file to specify the log level. By default, it
  will be `debug`.

Check the full `.env` file [example](./env-example) config for more details.

## Setup

### Starting the server

- Clone the repository to your machine
- Open the folder in a code editor of your choice
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  yarn install
  ```
- Run Postgres in Docker:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```
- Start the server (The server starts in port `8000` by default):
  ```bash
  yarn dev
  ```
- If the server fails due to the port being occupied, change the server port in the [package.json]
  file and in the `.env` file accordingly:
  ```json
  // file: package.json

  {
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "next dev -p <PORT>"
    }
  }
  ```
  ```bash
  # file: .env

  APP_URL="http://localhost:<PORT>"
  ```
- To expose your localhost API to public domain, open a new terminal and start NGROK:
  ```bash
  ngrok http <PORT>
  ```
- Copy the `.ngrok.io` link shown in your terminal:
  ```bash
  # Example:

  https://0c49-2601-646-9e00-80-3964-47d-7146-ff13.ngrok.io/
  ```

## Run with Docker

### Build

```bash
docker build . -t rarimo-poh:latest

[package.json] file and in the `.env` file, otherwise, you have to change the port accordingly in
the `docker-compose.yml` file in the `ports` section:

```yaml
# file: docker-compose.yml

services:
  rarimo-poh:
    image: rarimo-poh:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    entrypoint: sh -c "node_modules/.bin/next start"
